        <ChosenAnswer>Yes there is. Liebe is the verb &#039;to love&#039; and leben is the verb &#039;to live&#039;.
Liebe is pronounced &#039;lee-beh&#039; and leben is pronounced leh-ben&#039;&#039;</ChosenAnswer>

        <ChosenAnswer>There&#039;s no short form of &quot;Ich liebe dich so sehr&quot; because it means &quot;I love you so much&quot;.
&quot;Ich liebe dich&quot; means &quot;I love you&quot;.
It&#039;s really NOT the same to say &quot;I love you so much&quot; or to say &quot;I love you&quot; so plain and simple.</ChosenAnswer>

        <ChosenAnswer>it sounds like &quot;love you&quot; to me. if, for some reason, in some part of Germany, there&#039;s a slang subliminal message that makes it differ from its dictionary translation, or from &quot;i love you,&quot; then it&#039;s not evident in the words themselves.</ChosenAnswer>

        <ChosenAnswer>No. There is one simple rule for German: most words are exactly pronounced as they are spelled.
There are two versions of the &quot;ch&quot;-phoneme in German, one is voiced, the other one voiceless. The voiced one is pronounced like the ch in Loch Ness, the voiceless one is pronounced with less pressure. Imagine you try to hiss like a panther/ cat - that sound comes close to it. But the ch is never ever pronounced as &quot;k&quot; - only in southern dialects.

The e behind the i in &quot;liebe&quot; signifies that it is a long vowel like in the english &quot;geek&quot;, whereas the i in &quot;ich&quot; and &quot;dich&quot; is a short vowel like in the english &quot;hit&quot;.

So it&#039;s like Ich liiiiiiiiiiiiebe dich.</ChosenAnswer>

        <Content>During the months of trying to impose Anabaptist rule over the people how many executions were there?  Is it true they were planning world domination.
Another time Inrod, but God bless the Martyrs of the Vendean uprising.
They had to become peaceful, or die.
It was a little over 200 years ago..........
that is when they sought to dechristianize France..........sorry Paul

        <ChosenAnswer>Who knows how many were killed, probably dozens.  Then when a small army failed in an attack on Munster, 3000 died in the assault.  Later, about 50,000 Anabaptists were killed as part of the reprisal.  That is a dark time in Anabaptist history.  I am ashamed of it, but it was 500 years ago.</ChosenAnswer>

        <ChosenAnswer>i can&#039;t tell you much about the MÃ¼nster of Berne despite of being swiss. all the extensive descriptions are in german.

the most impressive fact is that there is a flat in the tower in a height of 61 meters (200 feet) for the guard of the tower. this flat was inhabited by a woman (picture on the link below) who was responsible for tourists (visitors of the MÃ¼nster) and other things until 2006.
http://www.bernermuenster.ch/munster/m-bm-tour-tur.html

wikipedia has a good description of the history of the MÃ¼nster (in german, the english version isn&#039;t done yet).
http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berner_M%C3%BCnster

the best impression of the bernese MÃ¼nster you can get on youtube from this video.

        <ChosenAnswer>You will have to buy the chipotle canned, in adobo sauce.  Ancho chilies are dried poblano chilies, and are the common ingredient in Chili Powder (along with cumin in the cheaper brands of chili powder) so if you look for a high quality chili powder you will have the ancho.

probably not a lot of Hispanic markets in Munster......</ChosenAnswer>

        <ChosenAnswer>PreuÃen MÃ¼nster is a football club in MÃ¼nster (3. division). A special highlight is a match against VFL OsnabrÃ¼ck (3. division too) (mostly riot). OsnabrÃ¼ck is approx 60 km away from MÃ¼nster.
In the 1. division plays Schalke 04 - 80 km  from MÃ¼nster a very popular club, and Borussia Dortmund (German football champion 2010) - 70 km from MÃ¼nster.
Schalke and Borussia are  deadly enemies too.

        <ChosenAnswer>As long as it isn&#039;t molded it is fine.  If it gets dried out it is tough or hard, but it still is edible.  If it isn&#039;t sliced even a little mold is fine, just trim of the molded portion and the rest is fine.</ChosenAnswer>
